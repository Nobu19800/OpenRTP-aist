   * @brief ModeCapable
   *
   * @section Description
   *
   * The ModeCapable interface provides access to an objecta?s modes
   * and a means to set the current mode.
   *
   * @section Semantics
   *
   * A given RTC may support multiple modes as well as multiple
   * execution contexts. In such a case, a request for a mode change
   * (e.g., from "cruise control on" to "cruise control off") may
   * come asynchronously with respect to one or more of those
   * execution contexts. The mode of an RTC may therefore be observed
   * to be different from one execution context to another.  - A mode
   * is pending in a given execution context when a mode change has
   * been requested but the new mode has not yet been observed by that
   * context.
   *
   * - The new mode has been committed in a given execution context
   *   when the context finally observes the new mode.
   *
   * - The new mode has stabilized once it has been committed in all
   *   execution contexts in which the RTC participates.
   *
   * Figure 5.26 depicts a state machine that describes mode
   * changes. Each parallel region in the composite state Mode Pending
   * represents an execution context. The trigger "sample" within
   * that state is considered to have occurred: - a?just before the
   * next call to on_execute (see Section 5.3.1.2.1) in the case where
   * immediate is false and the execution kind is PERIODIC, a?
   *
   * - a?just before the processing of the next stimulus in the case
   *   where immediate is false and the execution kind is
   *   EVENT_DRIVEN, or a?- a?immediately in all other cases.
