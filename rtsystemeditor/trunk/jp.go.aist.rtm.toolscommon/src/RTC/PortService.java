   *
   * @section Description
   *
   * An instance of the PortService interface represents a port (i.e.,
   * UML::Composite Structures::Ports::Port) of an RTC. It provides
   * operations that allow it to be connected to and disconnected from
   * other ports.
   *
   * @section Semantics
   *
   * A port service can support unidirectional or bidirectional
   * communication.  A port service may allow for a service-oriented
   * connection, in which other connected ports, invoke methods on
   * it. It may also allow for a data-centric connection, in which
   * data values are streamed in or out. In either case, the
   * connection is described by an instance of
   * ConnectorProfile. However, the behavioral contracts of such
   * connections are dependent on the interfaces exposed by the ports
   * and are not described normatively by this specification.
