   *
   * The ComponentAction interface provides callbacks corresponding to
   * the execution of the lifecycle operations of LightweightRTObject
   * (see Section 5.2.2.2) and ExecutionContext (see Section
   * 5.2.2.5). An RTC developer may implement these callback
   * operations in order to execute application-specific logic
   * pointing response to those transitions.
   *
   * @section Semantics
   *
   * Clients of an RTC are not expected to invoke these operations
   * directly; they are provided for the benefit of the RTC middleware
   * implementation.
